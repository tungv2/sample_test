#Install nodejs (I using: v14.17.4)

# Goto dir
cd app-001

# Install dependencies
npm install


# Start
npm start


#Test:

I'm sorry, I rarely use the test library (Jest)
Normally when joining a project, the functions and components will link together a lot.
This can take time, but I usually have to check by running the programs that each function is associated with to make sure it's working properly.
=> To always make sure that the code I wrote will not fail
